This period marked a surge in biometric technologies, with governments prioritizing the implementation of e-passports for enhanced border security and fraud prevention. According to industry reports, the global market size for e-passports grew from approximately USD 15 billion in 2018 to USD 22 billion by 2022.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Key drivers during 2018-2022:</strong> <ul> <li>Increased global security concerns and border control needs.</li> <li>Technological advancements in biometric verification (fingerprints, facial recognition).</li> <li>Growing international travel post-COVID-19, leading to higher demand for travel documents.</li> <li>Governments' efforts to modernize infrastructure and improve document issuance systems.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Demand Forecast: 2023-2033 â€“ Opportunities and Challenges</h2> <p>Looking ahead, the demand for e-passports is projected to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8-10% between 2023 and 2033. This expected growth is driven by several key factors:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Technological Advancements:</strong> The introduction of advanced biometrics, like iris scanning and 3D face recognition, is expected to further bolster security features in e-passports, making them even more reliable and harder to counterfeit.</li> <li><strong>Government Initiatives:</strong> Many countries are updating or replacing outdated passports with e-passports as part of their broader modernization initiatives. Notably, nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America are expected to be key drivers in this global expansion.</li> <li><strong>Post-pandemic Travel Surge:</strong> With international travel bouncing back after COVID-19 disruptions, the demand for secure, quick processing of passports will surge, further accelerating the market's growth.</li> <li><strong>Rising Threats of Cybersecurity:</strong> As cyber threats increase, e-passports equipped with enhanced security features like blockchain-based encryption will be in greater demand to protect sensitive data.</li> </ul> <h2>Regional Dynamics and Growth Hotspots</h2> <p>Regions such as Asia Pacific and Europe are expected to lead the e-passport market over the next decade. The United States, China, India, and the European Union are heavily investing in next-gen passport technologies.
