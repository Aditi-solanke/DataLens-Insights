Weiss, a traditional German wheat beer, gained substantial traction in international markets, with consumers becoming more adventurous in their beer choices.</p><ul> <li><strong>Craft Beer Boom:</strong> One of the most notable trends was the surge in demand for craft beers, including Weiss beers, especially in North America and Europe.
